Genetic algorithms process information to find a natural solution to a problem following a search heuristic. 
They are inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution that selects fittest individuals naturally for reproduction to produce next generation. 

The process of natural selection starts with the selection of fittest individuals from a population.

There are five phases in a genetic algorithm.

Initial population
Fitness function
Selection
Crossover
Mutation



AlgoHack Genetic Algorithm for University semaster plan creation
This algorithm uses a base data set of 1 batch, 1 semaster, 11 subjects, 11 educators, 1 Lecture Hall and 1 labs
They each have fitness index for selection.
0 : unfit, 1 : OK 2: Good 3: Exellent, 4: Must

The algorithm development process uses python and sqlite db.
1. Auto creates a Relational data base model 
2. Auto generate data in an iterative process using set of natural rules.
3. Create semaster plan through search and natural selection using natural rules.

Assumptions 
A semaster is 15 weeks. 15 * 5 days.
11 modules taught by 11 lecturers
Modules have lectures and lab sessions
There are 300 total sessions per semaster
Some modules have one or more lectures per week.
One lecturer may teach multiple modules
Lectures are prefered in morning and lab sessions in afternoon
Holidays have not been considered.
